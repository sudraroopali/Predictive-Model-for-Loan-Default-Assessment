# Predictive Model for Loan Default Assessment

## Loan Default Risk Assessment Model 🕵️‍♂️
Welcome to my Loan Default Risk Assessment Model project repository! Predicting loan default risk is a critical task in the world of finance, and we're here to make it even more intriguing! 🤩

## Project Overview 📢 
My mission is to predict loan default risk and assist financial institutions in making sound lending decisions! 💰 Using advanced predictive modeling techniques, I aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of loan default assessments, ultimately contributing to financial stability and responsible lending practices.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps uncover hidden insights in the data! Captivating count plots, mesmerizing histograms, and intriguing box plots were used to better understand the data. 📊

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is the key to a successful model! Outliers were treated and data was transformed using the Yeo-Johnson method. Categorical features were encoded with labels for the model's delight! 🧙‍♂️

📏 Scaling
Standard scaling is the secret weapon! It ensures that all features are on the same playing field, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

🤖 Model Development
An army of models was trained to predict employee attrition! From Logistic Regression 📈 to XGBoost 🚀

📊 Model Evaluation
The models are as good as they come! They were evaluated using a barrage of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

🎯 Feature Selection
To make the model even more focused, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to choose the best features.
